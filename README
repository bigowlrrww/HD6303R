HD6303R
====

This is a fork of an emulator for the Motorola 6803. As it is Bus compatiable with the HD6303R I snagged it and have used it as the base to create a functional emulator.
There is a ton of work to be done to ensure that every command is implemented and verified.

Functionality that isn't working that you might expect:
+ Interrupts
